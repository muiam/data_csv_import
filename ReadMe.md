## Difficulties Faced
- Ensuring the correct data types and column lengths in the table schema to match the CSV file structure was a bit challenging.
- The import left showed numbered columns (col 1 , col 2 ... etc) on top of the actual column names . This brought to a bad structure in the db
- Handling NULL values and date format issues during the import process.

## Interesting Observation
- I observed that the dataset has a very clear outline and can be used to show/perform deep data analysis for decision making
